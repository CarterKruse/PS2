Discussion Of Tests
Carter Kruse & John Deforest

CollisionGUI Test
- We added a new method to CollisionGUI.java called collisionDetectionTest() that creates two pairs of blobs of type 'b'
(Bouncer).
- One of these pairs was set such that they would start with offset x and y positions and velocities to
"collide"/overlap one another. The other pair was set so that they would just "miss" each other and not overlap.
- The colliding pair was expected to change color, while the non-colliding pair was expected to NOT change
color. Both of these cases were confirmed through our testing.
- To call the testing method, we used a keypress 't', which was bound in the handleKeyPress method (which already existed).

DotTreeGUI Test
- We added a test case, which is triggered by the keypress '2', which implements the testFind method previously provided.
- The test2 method codifies a couple of our test cases, by creating a tree and doing some searches on the tree.
- After a few iterations, when we compared the expected values to the actual results, we found that our test code
worked perfectly!
- The test evaluates how many times Geometry.circleIntersectsRectangle is expected to be called, how many times
Geometry.pointInCircle is expected to be called, and how many points are expected to be found.
