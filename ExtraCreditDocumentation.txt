Discussion Of Tests
Carter Kruse & John Deforest

CollisionGUIExtra
- We extended CollisionGUI to handle an additional blob type, namely ResoluteWanderer.
- The keystroke 'p' was mapped to creating a new blob of this type.

GeometryExtra
- We extended the Geometry class to include implementation of a pointInRectangle method that would be used for
findInRectangle in PointQuadtreeExtra.
- The boolean pointInRectangle method returns whether a point is within a rectangle, given the point x coordinate, point
y coordinate, top left x coordinate of the rectangle, top left y coordinate of the rectangle, bottom right x coordinate
of the rectangle, and bottom right y coordinate of the rectangle.

PointQuadtreeExtra
- We implemented a findInRectangle method that uses the quadtree to find all points within the rectangle.
- The parameters are the top left x coordinate of rectangle, top left y coordinate of rectangle, bottom right x
coordinate of rectangle, and bottom right y coordinate of rectangle.
- Similar to the findInCircle method, the findInRectangle method relies on a recursive helper method to accumulate all
the points.
- The accumulator method addPointsInRectangle adds all points in the rectangle to a list, recursively.
- The parameters are the list of points to consider when adding points to the list, top left x coordinate of rectangle, top left y
coordinate of rectangle, bottom right x coordinate of rectangle and bottom right y coordinate of rectangle.
- As indicated, the method is recursive, meaning that the method is called for the children of each node.

DotTreeGUIExtra
- We implemented a query function that uses the 'rectangle' mode, as opposed to the 'circle' mode for finding the points
near the mouse. This 'rectangle' mode is associated with the keystroke 'k', which shows up in handleMouseMotion,
handleKeyPress, and handleMousePress.
- Within the handleMousePress method, the findInRectangle method from PointQuadtreeExtra is implemented as appropriate.
- Further, the draw method is modified to reflect the inclusion of a query function that involves a rectangle, rather
than a circle. This draw method is responsible for displaying the rectangle at the mouse location, along with changing
the color of identified points (near the mouse) to black. (See Corresponding Image)
